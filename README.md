Building Docker from scratch to learn more about it and the language it uses to control it


1. Setup pedagogical OS XV6. We will first be building a hypervisor to understand what virtual machines to the fullest in comparison the physical machines.

Download VirtualBox, setup a linux instance on VirtualBox, then run these commands to get XV6 on said linux instance(https://www.assistedcoding.eu/2017/11/06/install-vx6-operating-system/).
