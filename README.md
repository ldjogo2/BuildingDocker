# XV6Play
Trying to learn more about the fundamental units my code runs on. This includes the OS, the VM, the Docker image, linux commands and what they mean in relation to the file system.


## Setup

1. Setup pedagogical OS XV6. We will first be building a hypervisor to understand what virtual machines to the fullest in comparison the physical machines.
Only when we understand what a VM is can we truly understand what Docker is.

Download VirtualBox, setup a linux instance on VirtualBox, then run these commands to get XV6 on said linux instance(https://www.assistedcoding.eu/2017/11/06/install-vx6-operating-system/).


This VM will be where most of our coding comes into play.
